## About
This project utilized Python and other python libraries to explore the TMDb dataset, focusing on analyzing movie performance across genres based on *revenue, popularity, and vote counts*.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Insights
The analysis indicated that Animation emerged as the top-performing genre across revenue, popularity, and audience vote metrics. Although animation films generally require higher production budgets compared to other genres, they exhibit a significantly higher return on investment.

## Development
This project offered an opportunity to develop my data analysis skills. I gained practical experience in data cleaning, handling missing values, identifying correlations, and effectively communicating findings through visualizations. Presenting my findings to my line manager further enhanced my ability to communicate data insights professionally.

## Requirements
To run this project locally, you'll need: Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook Pandas and other relevant Python libraries.
