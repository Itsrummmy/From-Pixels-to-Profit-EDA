# TMDB Exploratory Data Analysis Project
This project utilized Python and Pandas to explore the TMDb dataset, focusing on analyzing movie performance across genres based on *revenue, popularity, and vote counts*.

# Insights
The analysis indicated that Animation emerged as the top-performing genre across revenue, popularity, and audience vote metrics. Although animation films generally require higher production budgets compared to other genres, they exhibit a significantly higher return on investment.

# Development
This project helped me practice the complete EDA pipeline: data cleaning, handling missing values, exploring correlations, and visually presenting findings in a clear and understandable way. I also had the opportunity to present the findings to my line manager, gaining practical experience in presenting data insights professionally. 

# Requirements
To run this project locally, you'll need: Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook Pandas and other relevant Python libraries
